Whitley's Famous Mediterrian Mint Cocoa Recipe

1. Make a Cup of Hot Cocoa. Use store bought cocoa powder because it is cheap and delicious. Make sure it is HOT when is comes out of the microwave. Lukewarm cocoa need not apply.
2. Add a dash of malted milk powder.
3. Top with a small scoop of Talenti Mediterrian Mint gelato (no subsitutions)
4. Add a tiny sprig of mint leaf on top if you're feeling fancy.

Then drink up!

Optional: Add a bit of Bailey's Irish Cream. I won't judge you.

Cheers!
